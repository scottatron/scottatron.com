More Ruby Fiber goodnessâ€”this time a look at the Async gem by [Bruno Sutic](https://brunosutic.com)

> Async Ruby was created by Samuel Williams, who is also a Ruby core committer. Samuel also implemented "fiber scheduler", a big Ruby 3.0 feature. It's "library agnostic" and may have other uses in the future, but currently, the main purpose of fiber scheduler is to enable seamless integration of async gem with Ruby.
