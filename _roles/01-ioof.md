title: Infrastructure Programmer

date_active: 2014 - 2018
description: |
  During my initial 4 years at IOOF, I developed my skills in infrastructure automation, and software delivery tools, while contributing to our team’s efforts to make it easy for software delivery teams to efficiently delivery their software for the business.

  While I have been involved in all aspects of our team’s infrastructure automation work, I have given particular focus to our internal platform-as-a-service and the underlying Linux container ecosystem it is based on.

  I also often found myself in a de-facto technical lead position within the team, providing technical leadership, as well as mentoring less experienced members of the team.
